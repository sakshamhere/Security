Axoni startup - In 2020  Axoni announced that 15 sell-side and buy-side firms went live on its distributed ledger network for equity swap transactions. The first live trade was between Citi and Goldman Sachs.

The key benefit of the shared ledger is removing the need for reconciliations. Typically each party will record the transaction on their books, and they have to reconcile them with the counterparty. If there are millions of transactions, even automated reconciliation processes will produce numerous discrepancies that would need to be manually investigated. That costs time and hence money.
