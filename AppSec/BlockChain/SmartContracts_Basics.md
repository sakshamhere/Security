What is a smart contract?

A smart contract is a self-executing computer program that
automatically enforces the terms of an agreement between
parties. It operates without the need for intermediaries
and is built on blockchain technology, making it secure and
transparent. Smart contracts can be used in a wide range
of applications from financial transactions to supply chain
management.

Why should smart contracts be
reviewed?

Smart contracts must be reviewed to mitigate the risks of
errors, vulnerabilities, and other issues that could compromise
their security and functionality. By identifying potential risks and
opportunities to improve the code, reviews help reduce the risks
of costly mistakes, fraud and hacking attempts. Such reviews
can help stakeholders assess that the smart contract operates
as it has been designed, which is crucial for applications that
involve sensitive data or high-value transactions.


Smart contracts, once deployed, are immutable, meaning any vulnerabilities can be exploited after deployment. 

Tools like Slither, Mythril, and Echidna help find known vulnerabilities and analyze code behavior. 

Key aspects to review:

1. Reentrancy attacks: Ensure that external calls are properly handled and don't allow for re-entry into the contract. 

2. Arithmetic overflow/underflow: Implement checks to prevent unexpected behavior due to integer overflows or underflows, especially in financial calculations. 

3. Access control: Verify that access to sensitive functions and data is properly restricted. 

4. Input validation: Validate all inputs to prevent unexpected behavior or manipulation. 

5. External calls: Review interactions with external contracts and libraries for potential security risks.
